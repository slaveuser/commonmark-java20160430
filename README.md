commonmark-java
===============

Java library for parsing and rendering [Markdown] text according to the
[CommonMark] specification (and some extensions).

Provides classes for parsing input to an abstract syntax tree of nodes
(AST), visiting and manipulating nodes, and rendering to HTML. It
started out as a port of [commonmark.js], but has since evolved into a
full library with a nice API and the following features:

* Small (minimal dependencies)
* Fast (10-20 times faster than pegdown, see benchmarks in repo)
* Flexible (manipulate the AST after parsing, customize HTML rendering)
* Extensible (tables, strikethrough, autolinking and more, see below)

Requirements:

* Java 7 or above
* Works on Android, minimum API level 15 (see [commonmark-android-test](commonmark-android-test) directory)
* The core has no dependencies; for extensions, see below

Coordinates for core library (see all on [Maven Central]):

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.atlassian.commonmark</groupId>
    <artifactId>commonmark</artifactId>
    <version>0.5.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Note that for 0.x releases of this library, the API is not considered stable
yet and may break between minor releases. After 1.0, [Semantic Versioning] will
be followed.

See the [spec.txt](commonmark-test-util/src/main/resources/spec.txt) file if
you're wondering which version of the spec is currently implemented.

Usage
-----

#### Parse and render to HTML

```java
import org.commonmark.html.HtmlRenderer;
import org.commonmark.node.*;
import org.commonmark.parser.Parser;

Parser parser = Parser.builder().build();
Node document = parser.parse("This is *Sparta*");
HtmlRenderer renderer = HtmlRenderer.builder().build();
renderer.render(document);  // "<p>This is <em>Sparta</em></p>\n"
```

This uses the parser and renderer with default options. Both builders have
methods for configuring their behavior, e.g. calling `escapeHtml(true)` on
`HtmlRenderer` will escape raw HTML tags and blocks. For all available
options, see methods on the builders.

Note that this library doesn't try to sanitize the resulting HTML; that is
the responsibility of the caller.

#### Use a visitor to process parsed nodes

```java
Node node = parser.parse("Example\n=======\n\nSome more text");
WordCountVisitor visitor = new WordCountVisitor();
node.accept(visitor);
visitor.wordCount;  // 4

class WordCountVisitor extends AbstractVisitor {
    int wordCount = 0;

    @Override
    public void visit(Text text) {
        // This is called for all Text nodes. Override other visit methods for other node types.

        // Count words (this is just an example, don't actually do it this way for various reasons).
        wordCount += text.getLiteral().split("\\W+").length;

        // Descend into children (could be omitted in this case because Text nodes don't have children).
        visitChildren(text);
    }
}
```

### API documentation

Javadocs are available online on
[javadoc.io](http://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.atlassian.commonmark/commonmark).


Extensions
----------

Extensions need to extend the parser, or the HTML renderer, or both. To
use an extension, the builder objects can be configured with a list of
extensions. Because extensions are optional, they live in separate
artifacts, so additional dependencies need to be added as well.

Let's look at how to enable tables from GitHub Flavored Markdown.
First, add an additional dependency (see [Maven Central] for others):

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.atlassian.commonmark</groupId>
    <artifactId>commonmark-ext-gfm-tables</artifactId>
    <version>0.5.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Then, configure the extension on the builders:

```java
import org.commonmark.ext.gfm.tables.TablesExtension;

List<Extension> extensions = Arrays.asList(TablesExtension.create());
Parser parser = Parser.builder().extensions(extensions).build();
HtmlRenderer renderer = HtmlRenderer.builder().extensions(extensions).build();
```

To configure another extension in the above example, just add it to the list.

The following extensions are developed with this library, each in their
own artifact.

### Autolink

Turns plain links such as URLs and email addresses into links (based on [autolink-java]).

Use class `AutolinkExtension` from artifact `commonmark-ext-autolink`.

### Strikethrough

Enables strikethrough of text by enclosing it in `~~`. For example, in
`hey ~~you~~`, `you` will be rendered as strikethrough text.

Use class `StrikethroughExtension` in artifact `commonmark-ext-gfm-strikethrough`.

### Tables

Enables tables using pipes as in [GitHub Flavored Markdown][gfm-tables].

Use class `TablesExtension` in artifact `commonmark-ext-gfm-tables`.

### YAML front matter

Adds support for metadata through a YAML front matter block. This extension only supports a subset of YAML syntax. Here's an example of what's supported:

```
---
key: value
list:
  - value 1
  - value 2
literal: |
  this is literal value.
  
  literal values 2
---

document start here
```

Use class `YamlFrontMatterExtension` in artifact `commonmark-ext-yaml-front-matter`. To fetch metadata, use `YamlFrontMatterVisitor`.
